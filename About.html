            <p>
                I am an IT major at KSU who enjoys art, family, food, and lots of laughter. Chocolate is my lifeline and music is my escape.
            I have family across the east coast which opened up the opportunitie to travel and the love of roadtrips. I am originally from 
            New York, and my family then moved to New Jersey when I wa six, and then Georgia when I was 10. I have two siblings that are about to leave
            highschool, with one already starting college this year. A lot of interesting moves have happened in the past several years,
            and I didn't even picture myself studying IT, or having some of my most recent experiences before I entered college.
            </p>

            <p> In middle school I decided that I wanted to be a car designer. Art has been my hobby since kindergarten and I loved to experiment with 
                different crafts such as crotchet, duct tape items, and drawing. Drawing was the main past time for me, and I loved to draw horses and dragons
                in elementary school. Once I entered 7th grade, I grew an interest in cars. I honestly don't know how it started, it could have been
                Asphalt 8 that my cousin introduced me to, or the new James Bond and Transformers movie at the time, but I was obsessed with cars. I would draw
                them whenever I could and wanted to make that my career. I stuck with it all the way through highschool and chose mechanical engineering so that
                I could have the technical skills to be a designer but still have options is that path didn't work out. It was going well at first, but after making
                some mistakes with school work and a huge lack of motivation, I began to question my decision. I decided after a few months of thinking to switch to
                IT. Whether that was the right decision, I really don't know. However, I did like the idea of working with technology with data in particular.
                I liked the prospect of working with numbers to solve problems, and grew a huge interest in data trends and studies. I tend to be analytical, and
                althoug I am not the best at math, I still enjoyed analyzing graphs and understanding the why behind all sorts of questions. 
            </p>   

           <p> 
            Since making that decision, I am almost done with my degree, am slowly bringing my GPA back up after tanking it my sophomore year, and am working
            to develop my skills to become competitive in the job market. I've had a part-time job since April of 2021 that has been a great experience and 
            has given me experience working in a team and with customers which I am grateful for. I have finally joined a club which I am excited for, and have
            met all sorts of students that I got to hang out and work with. I am nervous for what is to come but also excited to see where this path will take me.
